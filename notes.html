                        <h3>Some things you need to know about the dataset</h3>
                        <p>While most case and other data is completely accurate, there are some unavoidable assumptions that have been required in order to present a complete dataset. Some provinces don't report every day, data released by some provinces has been later retracted or modified, and definitions for 'recovered' or even region boundaries have changed.</p>

                        <p>A few important notes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If a case is removed from any region, the latest case from that specific region is removed from the dataset</li>
                            <li>Some provinces report testing as 'people tested' (such as Quebec) whereas others report as 'total tests conducted'</li>
                            <li>Some provinces (such as British Columbia) do not report cases on weekends and others do not report cases on holidays; however they do report the number of Weekend/Holiday cases on the next weekday, resulting in correct case numbers but arbitrary regional distribution</li>
                            <li>If cases in a province are removed from a 'pending' region, they are added to the region with the greatest number of new cases on that particular day</li>
                            <li>In the event of changes in regional boundaries, any cases from regions with decreases in case numbers are moved to the closest region with the greatest increase of cases as a result of such regional distribution</li>
                        </ul>
